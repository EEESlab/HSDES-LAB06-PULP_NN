# HSDES-LAB06: PULP-NN

The goals of this lab session are:
1) Familirize with the PULP-NN library for DNN inference
2) Parallelize the PULP-NN convolutional layer, and understand its performance scaling
3) Experiment with different strategies to perform convolutions


## Getting Started
Open a shell and clone the repository with the sample code. 
Remember also to source the PULP-SDK configuration script. 
~~~~~shell
source /pulp/sourceme.sh
cd <working_dir>
git clone https://github.com/EEESlab/HSDES-LAB06-PULP_NN
